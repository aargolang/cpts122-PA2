a simulated music shuffler via a doubly linked list

<p>This is essentially a doubly linked list with the capabilities of sorting, shuffling, and making sub-play-lists. this could be expanded into a full application. Possible features is creating a "weighted" playlist that will play music that the program determines to be your favorite. by putting weights on songs and giving conditions for the user to manually or automatically weigh the songs there can be a "play my favorites" command that will create a playlist based on the weights</p>
